<!-- 
This XML file contains the meta data for files containing multiple data nodes.
It contains information about what field is used as a unique identifier for the
data node. This is used to increase the accuracy of the comparison logic of this
tool. Each element needs to follow the syntax of 

<node_name>key1,key2,key3,...</node_name>

Usage:

Imagine that you have an XML file that looks like this:

<storage>
  <food>
    <name>apple</name>
    <amount>12</amount>
  </food>
  <food>
    <name>steak</name>
    <amount>10</amount>
  </food>
  <food>
    <name>banana</name>
    <amount>5</amount>
  </food>
</storage>

Your intentions with this file is to create three data nodes of type 'food'. However,
without stating the element -> key pair in this file, the XML reader would interpret
this file as a single node of type 'storage' with three composite fields.

In order to create the three nodes of type 'food', you must declare "<food>name</food>"
under the 'nodes' element. This XML file should now look like this:

<nodes>
  <food>name</food>
</nodes>

Doing this will create three data nodes with these names :

- food.apple
- food.steak
- food.banana

Note: 
If multiple key exists inside a data node, it would use the first key found. 
"<food>name,amount</food>" would still give the same result because 'name'
would always be used as an identifier since it came before amount.
