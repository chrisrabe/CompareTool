<!-- 
This XML file contains the meta data for files containing multiple
composite fields with the same element name. It contains information
about what field is used as a unique identifier for the composite
field. This XML file is used to increase the speed and performance
of this tool. Each element needs to follow the syntax of

<field_name>key1,key2,key3,...</field_name>

Usage:

Imagine that you have two XML files that looks like this:

File 1:

<storage>
  <food>
    <name>apple</name>
    <amount>12</amount>
  </food>
  <food>
    <name>steak</name>
    <amount>10</amount>
  </food>
  <food>
    <name>banana</name>
    <amount>5</amount>
  </food>
</storage>

========================
File 2:

<storage>
  <food>
    <name>apple</name>
    <amount>50</amount>
  </food>
  <food>
    <name>steak</name>
    <amount>10</amount>
  </food>
  <food>
    <name>banana</name>
    <amount>5</amount>
  </food>
</storage>

=======================

The load event handler would interpret each file as one data node
with three composite fields. Each composite field will be of type
'food' and will all have the same name.

When comparing, the compare event handler would compare each field
with the name of 'food' against all the 'food' fields in the other
file. The comparison would be successful, however the performance
is poor because it would be comparing it n^2 times where n is the
number of fields with the name 'food'.

This file is used to attach the unique identifier to the composite
field. That way, fields are faster to find and compare.

If the XML file looks like this:

<fields>
  <food>name</food>
</fields>

Each file would create a storage data node with fields with these names:

- food.apple
- food.steak
- food.banana

This increases the performance because only a few composite fields
will be compared against each other.
