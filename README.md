# CompareTool
A tool for comparing configuration files. Repository will be removed at March. 
This tool is created for a company called "RightCrowd" in Australia.

### Note
This should work for any files containing a proper XML syntax. 
The only customisation you need to do is the look-up table if you have any ambiguious data.
