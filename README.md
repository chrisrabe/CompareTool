# CompareTool
A tool for comparing configuration files. Repository will be removed at March. 
This tool is created for a company called "RightCrowd" in Australia.

### Note
This should work for any files containing a proper XML syntax. 
The only file which needs to be customised is the data look-up table, if you
have any ambiguious data which needs to be converted into human readable format.
